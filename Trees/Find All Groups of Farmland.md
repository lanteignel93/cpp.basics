# Find All Groups of Farmland
## Description 
You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `land` where a `0` represents a hectare of forested land and a `1` represents a hectare of farmland.

To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist **entirely** of farmland. These rectangular areas are called **groups**. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is **not** four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group.

`land` can be represented by a coordinate system where the top left corner of `land` is `(0, 0)` and the bottom right corner of `land` is `(m-1, n-1)`. Find the coordinates of the top left and bottom right corner of each **group** of farmland. A **group** of farmland with a top left corner at `(r1, c1)` and a bottom right corner at `(r2, c2)` is represented by the 4-length array `[r1, c1, r2, c2].`

Return _a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above for each **group** of farmland in_ `land`_. If there are no groups of farmland, return an empty array. You may return the answer in **any order**_.

**Input:** `land = [[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,1]]`
**Output:** `[[0,0,0,0],[1,1,2,2]]`
**Explanation:**
```
The first group has a top left corner at land[0][0] and a bottom right corner at land[0][0].
The second group has a top left corner at land[1][1] and a bottom right corner at land[2][2].
```
**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/27/screenshot-2021-07-27-at-12-30-26-copy-of-diagram-drawio-diagrams-net.png)

**Input:** `land = [[1,1],[1,1]]`
**Output:** `[[0,0,1,1]]`
**Explanation:**
```
The first group has a top left corner at land[0][0] and a bottom right corner at land[1][1].
```
**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/27/screenshot-2021-07-27-at-12-32-24-copy-of-diagram-drawio-diagrams-net.png)

**Input:** `land = [[0]]`
**Output:** `[]`
**Explanation:**
There are no groups of farmland.

**Constraints:**

- `m == land.length`
- `n == land[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `land` consists of only `0`'s and `1`'s.
- Groups of farmland are **rectangular** in shape.
## Code 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findFarmland(vector<vector<int>>& land) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> res; 
        int ROWS = static_cast<int>(land.size()); 
        int COLS = static_cast<int>(land[0].size()); 

        for (int r = 0; r < ROWS; ++r){
            for (int c = 0; c < COLS; ++c) {
                if (land[r][c] == 1) {
                    int nr = r; 
                    int nc = c; 
                    while (nr < ROWS && land[nr][c] == 1){
                        ++nr;
                    }
                    --nr;
                    while (nc < COLS && land[nr][nc] == 1){
                        ++nc;
                    }
                    --nc; 
                    res.push_back({r, c, nr, nc}); 

                    for (int i = r; i <= nr; ++i) {
                        for (int j = c; j <= nc; ++j) {
                            land[i][j] = 2; 
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return res; 
    }
};

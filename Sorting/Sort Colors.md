# Sort Colors 
## Description 
You are given an array `nums` consisting of `n` elements where each element is an integer representing a color:

- `0` represents red
- `1` represents white
- `2` represents blue

Your task is to **sort the array in-place** such that elements of the same color are grouped together and arranged in the order: red (0), white (1), and then blue (2).

You **must not** use any built-in sorting functions to solve this problem.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]

Output: [0,1,1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [2,1,0]

Output: [0,1,2]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 300`.
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 2`.

**Follow up:** Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?
## Code 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int counts[] = {0, 0, 0}; 

        for (int num : nums) {
            counts[num]++; 
        }

        int i = 0; 

        for (int n = 0; n < 3; n++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < counts[n]; j++) {
                nums[i++] = n; 
            }
        }
    }
};
```

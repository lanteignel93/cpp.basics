# Key Problems 
 ```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID file.link as Problem,difficulty, status, stars, algo
FROM "Programming/DSA Learning"
WHERE isProblem AND algo = "Sliding Window" AND stars >= 4
SORT stars desc, difficulty desc
```

# Practice
 ```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID file.link as Problem,difficulty, status, stars, algo
FROM "Programming/DSA Learning"
WHERE isProblem AND algo = "Sliding Window" AND stars < 4
SORT stars desc, difficulty desc
```

# Boats to Save People
## Description 
You are given an integer array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries **at most** two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return the **minimum** number of boats to carry every given person.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: people = [5,1,4,2], limit = 6

Output: 2
```

Explanation:  
First boat `[5,1]`.  
Second boat `[4,2]`.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: people = [1,3,2,3,2], limit = 3

Output: 4
```

Explanation:  
First boat `[3]`.  
Second boat `[3]`.  
Third boat `[1,2]`.  
Fourth boat `[2]`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= people.length <= 50,000`
- `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 30,000`

## Code 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
        std::sort(people.begin(), people.end());
        int res = 0, l = 0, r = people.size() - 1;
        while (l <= r) {
            int remain = limit - people[r--];
            res++;
            if (l <= r && remain >= people[l]) {
                l++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
